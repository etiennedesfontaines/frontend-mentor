# Frontend Mentor challenges

Frontend Mentor challenges are aimed at improving coding skills by challenging its users to build projects from realistic briefs.

The challenges are categorized by difficulty (newbie, junior, intermediate, advanced and guru), allowing members at any stage of their frontend journey to benefit.

The Frontend Mentor community forms a support structure through which developers with varying amounts of experience offer each other feedback, encouragement and constructive criticism. All members are encouraged to ask for help, participate in code reviews and guide each other's learning.
