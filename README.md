# Frontend Mentor challenges

Frontend Mentor challenges are aimed at improving coding skills by challenging its users to build projects from realistic briefs.

The challenges are categorised by difficulty (newbie, junior, intermediate, advanced and guru), allowing memebers at any stage of their frontend journey to benefit. The Frontend Mentor community forms a support structure in which developers with varying amounts of experience offer eachother feedback, encouragement and constructive criticism. All memebers are encouraged to ask for help, participate in code reviews and help eachother learn and grow.
