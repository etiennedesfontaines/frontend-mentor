## My process

### I created a project overview as a sketch on paper.

I find sketching a build before executing it helps me approach it with a definitive plan.
It assists me in considering the project as a whole, evaluating semantics, styling, functionality and user experience.
I find it guides me to deeper learning and a more successful outcome than I experience if I don't start with a sketch.

#### HTML structure

I considered my HTML from two angles:

- Semantically to increase accessibility and aid search engine optimisation.
- Structurly, to ensure that it makes creating the supplied design as easy as possible.

#### CSS styling

I followed a mobile first approach for my CSS styling.

## What I learned

I still have a lot to learn about making designs responsive whilst keeping my code concise.

I recognized I was using far too many media queries to adjust the background bubble SVG's, but I persisted and am proud of what I accomplished with them. However, I later found a far more elegant solution using a combination of viewport width, height units and percentages to subtly change the position of the SVG's when the screen is resized. It's concise, responsive and aligned enough with the design to satisfy the brief.
