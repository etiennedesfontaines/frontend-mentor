## My process

### I created a project overview as a sketch on paper.

I find skething a build before executing it helps me approach it with a difinitive plan.
It allows me to consider the project as a whole, considering semantics, styling, funcionality and user experience.
I believe it guides me to deeper learning and a more succesful outcome than I experience if I don't start with a sketch.

#### HTML structure

I considered my HTML from two angles:

- Semantically to increase accessibility and aid search engine optimisation.
- Structurly, to ensure that it makes creating the supplied design as easy as possible.

#### CSS styling

I followed a mobile first approach for my CSS styling.

## What I learned

I still have a lot to learn about making designs responsive whilst keeping my code concise.

I noticed I was using far too many media queries, but I persisted and am proud of what I accomplished with them. I later found a far more elogant solution though. Using a combination of viewport width, height units and percentages to have the SVGs subtly change their position when the screen is resized. It's concise, responsive and aligned enough with the design to satisfy the design requirements.
