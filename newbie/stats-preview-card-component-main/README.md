## Intro

Hey there! :upside_down_face:

Thank you for taking a look at my solution to Frontend Mentor's [stats preview card component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62).

Please feel free to share your feedback and let me know how I might improve this iteration.

## Overview

For this challenge, I used...

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

## What I learnt

General:

It's beneficial to plan a project before initiating the build, because a good plan can help infrom the HTML semantics and structure, and make writing CSS a far smoother process.

Process documentation is a valuable skill and useful learning tool.
I found the practice of documenting my process made me more aware of where I struggled, why I struggled and what I learn't along the way.

CSS:

Image aspect ratio:
Setting an images width to 100% and height to auto maintains the images aspect ratio.

```CSS
img{
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

The CSS Box model:

I learnt that all CSS elements are surrounded by a box which affects how they behave.
I've found that understanding the different CSS box models (standard and alternate), along with their anatomy (margin, border, padding, content), and learning the behavioral characteristics of the different box types (block, inline, inline-block, flex and grid) has made the results of CSS style declarations far more predictable.

Git and Github:

I learnt to Create repositories and pull requests.

Bash and CLI:

I learnt the basics of using Bash and the command line.
