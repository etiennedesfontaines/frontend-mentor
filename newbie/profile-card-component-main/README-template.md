## My process

. Create new Github repo branch. 2. Paper-sketch project overview. 3. Structure HTML (semantically). 4. Styling (Sass). 5. Responsiveness (media queries). 6. Deploy site (Netlify). 7. Readme. 8. Push to github and submit on frontend mentore.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Extensive planning makes for well structured HTML and fluid styling.

### Continued development

1. I would like to deepen my understanding of Sass, and become more fluent using it. I am finding it an extremely concise way to write CSS, and the compiler esures any styles declared are widely compatible.

2. Continue challenging myslef with Frontend Mentore challenges.

3. Continue making time for code reviews.

4. Become more active in dev communities.
