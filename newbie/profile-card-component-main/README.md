## My process

1. Create new Github repo branch.
2. Paper-sketch project overview.
3. Structure HTML (semantically).
4. Styling (Sass).
5. Responsiveness (media queries).
6. Deploy site (Netlify).
7. Readme.
8. Push to github and submit on frontend mentore.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To make some designs responsive is more challenging. It requires attention to detail with proficient use of media queries.

### Continued development

1. I would like to continue developing my use of sass and emmet.

2. I intend to continue challenging and refining my skills through Frontend Mentor.

3. Deepening my JS problem solving skills through exercism.

4. Teaching others, doing code reviews and making an effort to engage with the online dev community more regularly.
