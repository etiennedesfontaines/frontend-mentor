## Overview

A challenge to build an FAQ component to a client's brief, without the use of JavaScript. Solution coded by Etienne Desfontaines, using HTML and SASS.

### The challenge

Build out this FAQ component and get it looking as close to the [design](./design) as possible. Use only HTML and CSS.

Follow the supplied [style guide](./style-guide.md)

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

HTML details and summary tags

Using a div as a wrapper to apply overflow hidden to specific absolutely positioned elements.

background-position-x and background-position-y

Sometimes a build is simpler than it looks and overthinking it can unecessarily complicate your process.

Just because a one screen is larger than another, doesn't mean it has more pixles.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
